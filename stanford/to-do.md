Abjad bootcamp to-do
====================

* Figure out which operating systems we will use (or admit) in the classroom
    * OSX: yes
    * Linux: ?
    * Windows: ?
* If we admit Windows then we will need to reauthor and **TEST** all of the
    operating-system specific modules ahead of time. Currently these are:
    * Operating system basics
    * Repository basics
    * Writing and running automated tests
