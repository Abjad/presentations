Abjad integrates with \textbf{IPython} (\emph{ipython.org/}):

\begin{quote}
IPython is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming
languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that
offers enhanced introspection, rich media, additional shell syntax, tab
completion, and rich history.
\end{quote}

\begin{frame}{SASHA}

\textbf{Sasha} provides a database of saxophone multiphonic recordings and
their associated fingerings, allowing users to search for related multiphonics
by timbral, harmonic and idiomatic descriptors.

    \item Multiphonics performed by \textbf{Eliot Gattegno}
        (\emph{http://eliotgattegno.com})
\end{itemize}

Abjad acts together with many other Python libraries to handle programmatic
notational output, and to perform validation on musical queries.
